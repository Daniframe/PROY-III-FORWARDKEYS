### Exploratory models / Association Rules
* Study of conditions on the cancellations .ipynb: Exploratory notebook where the idea for the relative frequency of cancellations from the deployment was developed. It also shows the conditions that lead to the most and least cancellations. It's deprecated and the import information is in the Deployment.
* Association_rules.Rmd: Study of rules to find which ones lead to the most and least cancellations. Similar to the python notebook but with association rules, it also derived in the creation of the deployment and basically is an outdated version of the deployment
